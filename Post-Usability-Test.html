          <h2> Usability Test for Zeeks Pizza website</h2>
          <p>Zeeks Pizza is a Seattle based Pizza business with 17 locations.
            Zeeks Pizza's website is
            <a href="http://www.zeekspizza.com">www.zeekspizza.com</a></href>.
            This post presents the results of a round of usability testing on the Zeeks Pizza website. </p>

          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/Zeeks/ZeeksHomePage.JPG" alt="Zeeks Pizza Home Page">
          <span class="caption text-muted">The Home Page for Zeeks Pizza.</span>

          <!--Information for Criterion 1-->
          <h3>Usability Test Overview</h3>
          <h4> Test Purpose </h4>
          <p>Identify the top issues that users encounter when creating an online order from Zeeks Pizza.
          </p>

          <h4>Test Methods</h4>
          <p>The tests were conducted in two ways. In person testing was done on a laptop and the Chrome web browser.
            Remote testing was conducted with the participant's laptop and choice of web browser. Tests were recorded
            using Zoom. The full script of this usability test can be downloaded
            <a href="files/ZeeksUsabilityTest.pdf" download> here</a>. </p>
          <h4>Participant Demographics</h4>
          <p>The usability tests were conducted with 3 participants between April 21st and April 25th. All participants
            typically
            spent multiple hours per week browsing the internet and had eaten pizza before. Two of the users were
            familiar with the business. One of the users had eaten at the restaurant. None of the participants had
            used the Zeeks Pizza website to order pizza before. </p>

          <h3>Test Results</h3>

          <h4>Issue 1: Confusing Online Ordering Menu</h4>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/Zeeks/orderMenuPage.JPG" alt="Online Ordering Home Page">
          <span class="caption text-muted">The first page of the online ordering process starts with the options "Tomato
            Base", "Adventurous Base", "Olive Oil Base".</span>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/Zeeks/adventurousBasePizzas.JPG" alt="Adventurous Base Pizza Ordering Page">
          <span class="caption text-muted">A selection of unique "Adventurous Base" pizzas are offered by Zeeks
            Pizza.</span>

          <p>All users were easily able to begin the online ordering process. However, all users paused on the first
            screen of the ordering menu. The unusual categorization of pizzas led to some confusion. Users described the
            large selection of pizzas on subsequent pages as overwhelming or confusing. One user thought
            the "Olive Oil Base" was the name of a pizza rather than a category of pizzas with olive oil as the primary
            sauce.</p>

          <h4>Proposed Improvement 1</h4>


          <p>Restructure the categorization of pizzas in the menu. Addition usability testing is recommended to
            determine the categorization that makes the most sense to customers. Based on other pizza websites, here are
            some ideas to test:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Group all pizzas into a top level category of Pizza. (This would sit along side other top level
              categories of "Salads and Starters", "Beverages", Desserts...)</li>
            <li>Categorize pizzas by primary topping: Meat, Chicken, Vegetarian, Choose Your Own.</li>
            <li>Categorize pizzas by familiarity: Popular, Basic, Specialty, Custom</li>
            <li>Categorize pizzas by base: Tomato, Olive Oil, Adventurous (or other), Choose Your Own</li>
          </ul>


          <h4>Issue 2: Half and Half Pizzas</h4>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/Zeeks/halfAndHalf.JPG" alt="Zeeks Pizza Half and Half Ordering Page">
          <span class="caption text-muted">The half and half ordering page for Zeeks Pizza offers a wide variety of
            options.</span>
          <p>Based on these tests, Zeeks Pizza has accurately identified that customers are interested in half and half
            pizzas. Users were delighted to be able to customize their pizza in this way on the website. However, they
            had trouble selecting the pizza types on the Half and Half ordering page. There are lots of pizza options,
            but no descriptions of the pizzas. Participants didn't know what a "Frog Belly Green" pizza was or how it
            differed from a "Buffalo Soldier".
          </p>
          <h4> Proposed Solution 2</h4>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/Zeeks/halfAndHalfProposed.JPG"
            alt="Zeeks Pizza Half and Half Ordering Page with product descriptions">
          <span class="caption text-muted">The addition of pizza descriptions helps users choose their pizza.</span>

          <p>Add pizza descriptions to the Half and Half pizza ordering page. To keep the ordering page minimal, these
            could appear only upon mouse over. </p>
          <p>Another way to help participants process the vast options on this page
            would be to categorize the pizzas by type, leveraging the same type categories used on the whole pizza
            ordering section.</p>


          <h4>Issue 3: Store hours are not accurate</h4>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/Zeeks/locationAndHours.JPG" alt="Zeeks Pizza Location & Hours Page">
          <span class="caption text-muted">The Location and Hours Page states temporary hours of 11am-9pm.</span>

          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/Zeeks/greenlakeLocation.JPG" alt="Zeeks Pizza Greenlake Page">
          <span class="caption text-muted">The Greenlake Store Page states hours of 11am-10pm.</span>

          <p>On the Hours and Location page for all Zeeks Pizza locations, there is an announcement for temporary store
            hours of 11am-9pm for most locations. </p>
          <p>Two
            of the test participants read the incorrect information on the Greenlake store detail page without seeing
            the special annoucement of temporary hours.</p>
          <p>Customers who wanted a late dinner pizza delivery may be disappointed to discover that Zeeks is already
            closed. Users may be frustrated and lose trust in the information presented on the Zeeks Pizza website if the
            store hours information they read on the
            website is inaccurate.</p>
          </p>

          <h4> Proposed Improvement 3</h4>

          <p>In addition to the special announcement of temporary changes to the store hours, the store hours on the
            individual store location pages should also be updated.
          </p>
