          <h2>Usability Test for Zeeks Pizza Mobile Website</h2>
          <p>Zeeks Pizza is a Seattle based Pizza business with 17 locations.
            Zeeks Pizza's website is
            <a href="http://www.zeekspizza.com">www.zeekspizza.com</a></href>.
            This post presents the results of a round of usability testing on the Zeeks Pizza website. </p>

          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/ZeeksMobile/mobileZeeksPizzaHomePage.png" alt="Zeeks Pizza Mobile Home Page">
          <span class="caption text-muted">The Mobile Home Page for Zeeks Pizza.</span>

          <h3>Mobile Usability Test Overview</h3>
          <h4> Test Purpose </h4>
          <p>Identify the top issues that users encounter when creating a mobile online order from Zeeks Pizza.
          </p>

          <h4>Test Methods</h4>
          <p>The tests were conducted over Zoom meeting. Zeeks Pizza mobile website was accessed on an iPhone and a
            Samsung phone. The full script of this usability test can be downloaded
            <a href="files/ZeeksMobileUsabilityTest.pdf" download> here</a>. </p>

          <h4>Participant Demographics</h4>
          <p>The usability tests were conducted with 2 participants on May 2nd. The participants were heavy internet
            users for both work and personal tasks. None of the participants had
            used the Zeeks Pizza website to order pizza before. </p>

          <h4>Test Scope</h4>
          <p>Participants were asked to complete these 3 tasks on the mobile version on the website.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Task 1: Find out when the Zeeks Pizza nearest you is open today.</li>
            <li>Task 2: Determine if Zeeks Pizza will deliver pizza to your home.</li>
            <li>Task 3: Prepare an online order of a complete meal for your household.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Test Results</h3>
          <h4>Mobile Vs Laptop Experience</h4>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/ZeeksMobile/mobileZeeksPizzaOrderPage.png"
            alt="Initial Mobile Pizza Ordering Page for Zeeks Pizza">
          <span class="caption text-muted">The initial pizza ordering page.</span>
          <p>Interestingly, the biggest issue users experienced on a laptop didn't phase the mobile test participants.
            While laptop users were confused by the number of pizza options and the categorization of pizzas, mobile
            users jumped right into selecting pizzas. The pages are very similar on mobile and laptop, so I was suprised
            to see such a difference and wonder if I was see different results with a larger pool of participants.</p>

          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/Zeeks/orderMenuPage.JPG" alt="Online Ordering Home Page">
          <span class="caption text-muted">Laptop version of the initial ordering page confused users, while the mobile
            version did not.</span>

          <p>Users of both versions of the site praised the visibility of the Order Online button and were easily able
            to start the online orders process.</p>
          <p>Neither of the mobile test partcipants tried to configure a half and half pizza, so I wasn't able to see if
            that continued to be an issue on the mobile site. However one participant commented on how easy it was to
            configure a pizza on the mobile site.</p>

          <h4>Mobile Issue 1: User Log-in Required</h4>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/ZeeksMobile/mobileZeeksSignIn.png" alt="Mobile Sign-in Page">
          <span class="caption text-muted">Before participants could begin an online order, they are required to log-in
            or sign up with the site.</span>

          <p>Both participants expressed mild frustration with having to create a sign-in to begin the ordering process
            and before they could view the online ordering menu. This step was not required for the laptop version.
          </p>

          <h4>Proposed Improvement 1</h4>


          <p>Follow the same ordering process as the other version of the site and only require users to provide a
            delivery address before starting the order. The rest of the user details can be collected during check-out.
          </p>


          <h4>Issue 2: Pint or Scoop?</h4>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/ZeeksMobile/mobileDesserts.png" alt="Zeeks Pizza Dessert Page">
          <span class="caption text-muted">The photos for pint sized serving and single scoop servings of ice cream are
            the same.</span>
          <p>While this issue is not unique to mobile, the user who added ice cream to their order was suprised at the
            low cost of some of the ice cream. They had added both pints and single scoops to their card without
            noticing the
            difference. The photo for a single serving of ice cream is the same as the photo of a pint of ice cream.
          </p>

          <h4> Proposed Solution 2</h4>
          <p>Use different photos for pints and single servings of ice cream. Possibly use the photo of the pint carton
            for pints and a photo of a scoop of ice cream for the single servings. Also, I recommend clarifying the
            label of the "single" ice cream option to a word that better describes its size relative to a pint. This
            could something like be "mini cup" or "5 oz."</p>


          <h4>No Longer an Issue...</h4>

          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/ZeeksMobile/mobileZeeksGreenlakeLocation.png" alt="Zeeks Pizza Location Specific Hours - Mobile">
          <span class="caption text-muted">The Greenlake Store hours have been updated to accurately reflect temporary
            hours.</span>

          <p>In the past week, Zeeks Pizza has updated the hours throughout their website to reflect the current
            temporary store hours. This means that users will see the correct store hours no matter where they look.
            Both mobile and laptop users will benefit from this correction.</p>
          <p> This is great news because this week's mobile testing re-iterated the importance of this correction because users continues to use
            different paths to look up store hours. Half of the users referenced the temporary store hours announcement
            while the other half looked up their closest location first.</p>
